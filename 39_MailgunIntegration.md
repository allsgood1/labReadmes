Spam Some Emails to Yourself

The goal of this lab is to integrate a 3rd Party API into your code! It's fairly straightforward, and most problems can be solved by following the API's documentation, the walkthroughs, or the reference! Let's start spamming!
Steps
Backend

    Sign up for a Mailgun Account.
    Get a sandbox domain and api key.
    Install the necessary module and typings.
    Establish your connection with Mailgun.
    Code a sendEmail function.
    Code a route to send an email using that function.
    Test the route in POSTMAN to confirm it works.

Frontend

    Adjust your route to accept an email, subject, and message from the request body.
    Create a form in a React component with 3 inputs that match up with the above 3 parameters.
    Make sure they're controlled inputs that properly set state and are safely typed.
    Make your form perform an onSubmit event that makes a POST request to your endpoint.
    Make sure you received an email from your contact form.
